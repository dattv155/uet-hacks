# covid-tracing

The covid-19 is back in Vietnam and hits UET. I did this to check if I'm F2, F3 or not. Hope it helps you as well.

```sh
python trace.py <student ID>
Eg. python trace.py 18020001
```

The program is not optimized yet because it's using UET's APIs and most people may actually run it once in their life :| 

Also I might not be able to optimize it becoz I'm F3 :'( I'm ded
